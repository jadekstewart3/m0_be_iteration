# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I feel quite confident. It didnt feel too challenging to write solutions to the challenges, yet!

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I very much enjoyed this portion of work. I got a little stuck while I was reviewing the lesson, but was able to reach out in Slack, and recived an answer. It was a bit of syntax that I had forgotten, now its not so hard to remember

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I am going to work ahead a little bit to try to link the concepts we've learned to content that we will be learning. This will help me solidify my understanding of what we learned, and prime my brain for the road ahead. I schedule in plenty of self directed study time, so no need to adjust my calender! 

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
The only question that I have come across so far was if I could use an if statement when calling the each method on an array, then I thought about it and googled the syntax for it. Turns out, yes, you can, and it seems quite useful!
